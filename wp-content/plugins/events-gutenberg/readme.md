# The Events Calendar: Gutenberg Extension

We've made significant rewrites and refactors of our products over the years, but adapting our plugins to fully integrate with the new editor coming in WordPress version 5.0, code-named "Gutenberg" **is the biggest ecosystem change weâ€™ve faced since the introduction of custom post types.**

This plugin is our first attempt at integrating the Event post type with the Gutenberg editor. Download this plugin as a .zip and install it on your site like any other plugin, or use the _Using developement Version from GitHub_ steps below.

:warning: **Please Note:** This is an Alpha-version plugin at this point; while we test thoroughly and hope to code well, _we do not recommend running this on production sites_.

---

### Using development version from GitHub

1. Clone the Repository
2. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
3. Run `npm install` on the repository
4. Run `npm run bootstrap` to bootstrap the plugins
5. Run `npm run build` to build out the assets

#### Production

To build for production

```sh
npm run build
# To only build for certain plugins
npm run build -- --scope=@moderntribe/common,@moderntribe/events
```

#### Development

To watch files for development

```sh
npm run dev
# To only run watchers for certain plugins
npm run dev -- --scope=@moderntribe/common,@moderntribe/events
```

#### Analyze bundles

This will open a browser window showing current bundle sizes for a plugin.

```sh
npm run analyze
# To only analyze certain plugins
npm run analyze -- --scope=@moderntribe/common
```

### Adding new plugins

From the root, we'll need to symlink the new plugin so that it can be looked up via npm. Just doing the command below will do the trick.

```sh
npm install --save plugins/*
```

#### Symlinking folders

Since the folder structure we use is not node-friendly, we have to symlink directories from within the plugin's `src/modules` directory into the root of the plugin. This allows plugins to be properly imported when importing a module i.e. `@moderntribe/events/blocks` would have to be `@moderntribe/events/src/modules/blocks` if we did not do this.

Add a new `scripts` folder within the plugin with a `linkDependencies` bash script.

```sh
mkdir scripts
touch scripts/linkDependencies
chmod +x scripts/linkDependencies
```

Add into the script something like:

```sh
#! /bin/bash

ln -sf $PWD/src/modules/[bundleName] $PWD # Add one for each bundle
```

Now add in a `bootstrap` script into the plugin's `package.json`
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "bootstrap": "./scripts/linkDependencies"
    }
}
```

Finally, run `npm run bootstrap` from the root to link the plugin up.
