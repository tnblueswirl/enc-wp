The Events Calendar is a carefully crafted, extensible plugin that lets you easily share your events. Beautiful. Solid. Awesome.

== Description ==

> **Note: This is an Alpha-version plugin at this point; while we test thoroughly and hope to code well, _we do not recommend running this on production sites_.**

We've made significant rewrites and refactors of our products over the years, but adapting our plugins to fully integrate with the new editor coming in WordPress version 5.0, code-named "Gutenberg" **is the biggest ecosystem change weâ€™ve faced since the introduction of custom post types.**

This plugin allows you to use The Events Calendar with the Gutenberg development plugin's block editor. Download this plugin as a .zip and install it on your site like any other plugin, or use the _Using developement Version from GitHub_ steps below.
